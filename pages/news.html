        </p>Frank Sinatra fans are going to want to make their way over to Malibu right about now. The legendary singer’s former
        Broad Beach getaway just popped up for rent, but it’s going to cost a whole lot more than downloading a few of Sinatra’s
        songs. Indeed, the 5,824-square-foot abode is asking a staggering $110,000 a month as a summer rental, and it just
        so happens to be the first time it has ever been offered as a temporary lease.

        <p>News Rating *****</p>
        <p class="card-text">(CNN)Nancy Sinatra Sr., first wife of legendary singer Frank Sinatra, died Friday at the age of 101, her daughter
          said. "My mother passed away peacefully tonight," her daughter, the singer also named Nancy Sinatra, tweeted Friday
          night. "She was a blessing and the light of my life. Godspeed, Momma. Thank you for everything." Her death comes
          two decades after her husband's, who died of a heart attack in 1998 at the age of 82. "Ol' blue eyes" was one of
          the most influential singers in the nation, and also appeared in blockbuster films such as "From Here to Eternity"
          and "The Man With the Golden Arm." Nancy Barbato and Frank Sinatra started dating when they were teens. They married
          in 1939 at a church in New Jersey, and as a wedding present, he gave her a record of a song called "Our Love" that
          he made for her.</p>

        <p class="card-text">9th of May, 1998 The new millenium was in sight. Dad was determined to be a part of it. “How many more months?” he
          asked me. Eighteen, I told him, rounding down a bit. “Oh, I can do that” he said. “Nothin’ to it.”… 14th of May,
          1998 The phone rang at exactly 11:10 pm. It was Rex Kennamer. “I have bad news, we lost him.” “Lost who?” I said.
          “Your father. I’m sorry.” 13 years ago, Barbara Sinatra was outside for dinner. Frank Sinatra’s situation suddenly
          got worse and he was taken to hospital at around 9pm. The doctors called Barbara immediately, and tried to save
          Sinatra for like 1,5 hour. Despite how long they tried, they couldn’t save him. In the end, at 10:50pm, Frank Sinatra
          died from a heart attack… And at 11.10pm, Tina Sinatra was informed that her father had passed away. She called
          Nancy and in minutes they got to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.Oh God, take him and make him safe and warm, but keep him close to me. And to him: I am so sorry
          I was not here for you. I was filled with guilt and anger, but kept those feelings contained. I just kept saying
          to myself that I loved him, over and over again…” In Sinatra family, Frank Sinatra’s death and the funeral arrangements
